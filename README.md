This is a modified version of Peter Theill's Redmine "basecamp" theme. You can
find Peter's original version here:

    http://theill.com/stuff/redmine/

We have made a few small changes for our internal Redmine instance, and thought
others might find it useful. See the [history] [1] for details.

-------

To install, just clone into your Redmine theme dir like so:
