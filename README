This is a modified version of Peter Theill's original Redmine "basecamp" theme.
You can find Peter's original version here:

We have made a few small changes for our internal Redmine instance, and thought
others might find it useful. See the changesets for details.

INSTALL

To install, just clone into your Redmine theme dir like so:

    $ cd /path/to/redmine/public/themes
    $ git clone http://github.com/albion/redmine-basecamp-theme.git basecamp
